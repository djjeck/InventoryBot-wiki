 * reads on disk, and their pages are read, with the text files they link to. Which files
 * are pages, which files a page links to, and the warnings, are decided by
 * export-listing.ts, as on disk.
 *
 * No DOM types: a file is anything with a relative path and its bytes (FileLike), so the
 * adapter also runs in Node, on objects built by the tests.
